# A Legal Resource for Node Operators

The Radicle project is committed to fostering a decentralized and
censorship-resistant internet. We believe in the power of distributed systems to
promote freedom of information and resist single points of control. Without
seeking to patronize or intending to introduce centralized content moderation
elements, we want to provide node operators with certain best practices that
seem to properly address illegal and harmful content while maintaining our core
belief in decentralization and censorship resistance. By doing so, we hope you
will be part of maintaining a safe and lawful Radicle ecosystem for all
participants.

operators are responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations. This notice does not absolve node operators from any
liability arising from storing or distributing illegal or harmful content.

This resource may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in applicable

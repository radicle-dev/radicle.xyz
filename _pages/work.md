# Work for Radicle

<em><span class="dim">Radicle is an open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git.
Unlike centralized code hosting platforms, there is no single entity controlling the network.
Repositories are replicated across peers in a decentralized manner, and users are in full control of their data and workflow.
</span></em>

We are seeking talented people to join us in contributing to Radicle and this page lists open positions we are looking to fill.
Contact us via [radicle.zulipchat.com][zulip] or [work@radicle.xyz](mailto:work@radicle.xyz) with your application.
Unsolicited applications, i.e., ones that fit none of the positions below, are also welcome.

Note that we currently are:
 - A team of three.
 - Fully remote within the European Union.
 - Set up on a contracting/freelance basis.

## Application Process

The application process is the same for all roles listed below:

1. After contacting us, please allow for seven to ten days for us to get back to you.
   We review applications once per week, and do so manually and thoroughly.
1. We invite you to an initial chat about your previous experience, allowing for discussions of questions.
2. The chat might conclude with us posing a collaborative task to you, especially if you have not contributed to Radicle prior to your application.
   For details on what this task might be, refer to the description of position you are applying for.
   In all cases it will be a predefined task, which will be explained by us to set you up for success.
   Of course we will answer your questions for clarification.
   We will provide payment for up to 10 hours of work spent on this task.
   However, at a reduced rate of 50 EUR per hour.
3. If you have been posed with the task, the intent is that you work on it, and report back to us.
   Often times this will mean more interaction, for example getting a patch merged to one of our Git repositories.
4. We invite you to a final chat, which concludes the application process.

This applies after a successful application as well for the work completed on the interview task during the application process (if the task was posed).

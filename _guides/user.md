Software is *the* fundamental way in which we interface with data that
comprises our current reality, and code is the language of software. Most
software systems were created through a collaborative process involving
multiple people. If we accept that software is important and collaborative by
nature, then a shared system for communicating about code and collaborating is
needed. This system shouldn't be owned by one company, as code is too important
to be monopolized.

<aside class="span-2">
  <p> Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They also own 49% of OpenAI. One of
  our prophets of the future, the author Philip K. Dick, has shown us many
  projections of alternate dystopian realities that emerge when corporations
  amass too much power. </p>
  <p> While some may question the reliability of his visions as
  he was often fueled by substances that would make even psychonauts raise an
  eyebrow, consider this: the Oracle at Delphi's officiant claimed to glimpse
  through the veil by inhaling naturally occurring gasses emerging from the
  ground. </p>
</aside>

Furthermore, our world is increasingly polarized, and this reality is finding
its way into software companies and therefore into software products. Users are
banned from using a platform because of their geographic location or the ideas
they stand for. This is not tenable.

This is why we’ve created Radicle, an open protocol that enables users like you
to collaborate on your code within a sovereign network. It's a neutral
environment where you have full ownership of your data and you have the
autonomy to set the rules of your code universe as you see fit. You can work on
software projects (and ultimately more) even when offline, while also being
connected to a broader network, through which you'll eventually be able to find
contributors.

We've created this Radicle Guide to initiate you as a settler of our network
through teaching you how to use the software we've developed—the Radicle
CLI, which is both a node and command line interface tool for interacting with
the protocol. This guide is split into multiple chapters and we recommend
starting with the first chapter for a higher level introduction that takes you
on a tour through Radicle's core functions. Subsequent chapters will provide
deeper dives into specific use cases, but they are still in progress.

<aside> The Radicle manual can be accessed by entering <code>man

## 1. Getting Started

One of the important facts to understand about Radicle is that it is a
peer-to-peer protocol, which is uncommon when it comes to software you
typically rely on. Most collaboration technologies are hinged upon a
client-server model, where you're entrusting your data and social interactions
to a single entity that is managing a bunch of servers or data centers. This
paradigm is transformed in a peer-to-peer protocol, where every user of the
protocol is a *peer*, participating equally. Peers on the Radicle network are
also referred to as **nodes**, and it doesn't matter what you are doing --
whether you're publishing repositories or discussing issues -- you have to run
a node.

Within a few paragraphs, you'll be operating a Radicle Node via the command
line by installing the Radicle software stack. It's a pretty easy process that
can be completed in under 5 minutes, but there are a few requirements that are
important to run through before you proceed:

1. You need a <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>Unix</strong> based operating
   system like macOS or Ubuntu and a basic understanding of how to use your
   terminal.
2. Radicle is built on top of <strong>Git</strong>, so a recent version of Git
   (2.34.0 or later) is recommended. We also assume you have *some* experience
   using Git.
3. OpenSSH (version 9.1 or later) with <strong>ssh-agent</strong> has to also
   be installed and running. This is a helper program that is used to secure
   the secret key related to your Radicle identity.

<aside> What is <strong>Git</strong>, you wonder? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> is a distributed version
control system that manages and tracks changes in computer files, predominantly
used for source code and collaborative programming. </aside>

### Installation

The easiest way to install Radicle is by firing up your terminal and running
the following command:

    $ curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh

This command runs an installer script that automates the setup process, by:

* Identifying your OS, and installing Radicle binaries suitable for your
  system, including `rad`, `git-remote-rad`, `radicle-node`, and
  `radicle-httpd`, all placed in `~/.radicle/bin` by default. This is a
  non-standard location, so the script also updates your `PATH` variable to
  include the path to these binaries.
* Installing `man` pages into `~/.radicle/man`, which enables you to access
  the Radicle CLI user manual through `man rad` or `rad help`.

> 👾

> If you want the above to be installed in a different location than
> `~/.radicle`, you can pass `--prefix` to the installation script, eg.
> `--prefix=/usr/local`.
>
> Note that if you don't want to use the installer script, you can also always
> compile from the [source code][heartwood] or get the [binaries] if you
> prefer.

Once you've installed Radicle, you can make sure that it was successful by
running:

    $ rad --version

### Come into being from the *elliptic aether*

When using Radicle for the first time, you have to create a new Radicle
identity, which is simply a cryptographic key pair, using the `rad-auth`
command. The public key is what uniquely identifies you across the network,
while the private key is used to authenticate your node, as well as sign code
and other artifacts you publish on the network.

<aside class="span-5">
  <p> A <strong>cryptographic key pair</strong> is a set of two keys used in
  cryptography, typically for securing digital communication and data.</p>

  <p> The pair consists of a public key and a private (or secret) key. The
  public key can be shared with others and is used to encrypt data or verify
  digital signatures created with the corresponding private key. Conversely,
  the private key is kept secret by the owner and is used to decrypt data
  encrypted with the public key or to create digital signatures. </p>

  <p> The use of these keys ensures authenticity, as digital signatures can
  confirm that a message or data was indeed sent by the owner of the private
  key. </p>
</aside>

    $ rad auth

That's how you'll cryptographically forge your new Radicle identity.

Follow the instructions by entering an **alias**, a non-unique name that makes
it easier to identify your node, in addition to a **passphrase** to protect
your key pair. Note that your alias can always be changed at a later time.

    $ rad auth

    Initializing your radicle 👾 identity

    ✓ Enter your alias: paxel
    ✓ Enter a passphrase: ********
    ✓ Creating your Ed25519 keypair...
    ✓ Adding your radicle key to ssh-agent...
    ✓ Your Radicle DID is did:key:z6Mkhp7VUnuufpvuQ3PdysShAjL86VDRUpPpkesqiysDBGs9. This identifies your device. Run `rad self` to show it at all times.
    ✓ You're all set.
    ...

When you've completed the steps, your new Radicle DID (Decentralized Identifier)
will be generated and displayed. If `ssh-agent` is running, your private key will
also be added to it for future use. While similar to your Node ID (NID), the Radicle
DID is formatted as a [Decentralized Identifier][did], whereas the NID is simply the
encoded public key. The Radicle DID is your own [self-sovereign][ssi] identity. Share
it freely with collaborators!


<aside class="span-4">

If you run `rad auth` again you can verify that your key was added to
`ssh-agent`.

If you forget your DID or NID, you can query your full identity by running `rad
self` or alternatively you can grab your DID with `rad self --did` and your NID
with `rad self --nid`.

```
$ rad self
Alias           paxel

├╴Keys          /home/paxel/.radicle/keys
└╴Node          /home/paxel/.radicle/node
```

This displays your alias, DID, Node ID, SSH agent status, SSH keys, and the
locations of important files or directories.

### Operate nodes, smoothly

Now that your node has an identity (or 'public key'), you have what it takes to
connect to the Radicle Network. That's right -- we don't need your email
address or any other personal identifying information. Your alias can be your
cat's name for all we care.

The first command to embed deep within your consciousness is the one for
checking your node's status:

    $ rad node status

If the node is not running, you can start it as a background daemon with:

    $ rad node start

After your node starts, it will attempt to connect to peers on the network.

But let's take a step back and ponder some fundamental questions: *What exactly
happens when these nodes interact? And how does Git fit into this picture?*

At its core, Radicle marries Git with peer-to-peer networking. Your node isn't
just another cog in the machine; it's a conduit for collaboration. It's there
*to host and synchronize repositories you're interested in*.

Radicle's peer-to-peer architecture draws inspiration from [Secure
Scuttlebutt's][ssb] gossip protocol where data transmission relies on a
publish/subscribe system, allowing peers to host and sync only the data they
care about. Similar to [BitTorrent][bt], we use the terminology "seeding" to
describe distributing and sharing a repository across the network.

With Radicle's gossip protocol, peers exchange messages about the network that
facilitate the discovery and replication of repositories. The replication
process kicks off when a node establishes a secure connection with another
node, the initiating node conducts a *fetch* operation via the Git protocol to
pull the pertinent objects into the node's storage, thereby availing them to
the local user and other interested nodes.

<aside> <strong>Replication</strong> is the process of creating multiple copies
<em>(replicas)</em> of data across a network of peers to ensure redundancy,
improve reliability and enhance access speed. </aside>

> If you're curious about how Radicle works under the hood, read our
> [Protocol Guide][proto].

### Git going with repositories

Now, time to return to your terminal. The next thing we'll do is publish a
repository to the Radicle network. Once we've done this, anyone with a node
will be able to fetch and seed your repository, increasing its replica count
on the network.

<aside class="span-3"> We built Radicle on good old Git, the go-to for version control
because, well, it is widely used and works extremely well. For a zeptosecond,
we considered inventing a new system but heard a strong shout in our brains
that said something like "YOU'D BE SO STUPID TO REINVENT VERSION CONTROL RIGHT
NOW". </aside>

Pick a repository you maintain and navigate to a local copy. It can be any Git
repository, but it should have at least one commit.

    $ pwd
    /home/paxel/src/dark-star

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
    nothing to commit, working tree clean

To publish it to the Radicle network, run the `rad init` command.

    $ rad init

    Initializing radicle 👾 project in .

    ✓ Name: dark-star
    ✓ Description: Decoding data from the dark star to establish a model of the universe
    ✓ Default branch: main
    ✓ Visibility: public
    ✓ Project dark-star created.

    Your project's Repository ID (RID) is rad:z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna.
    You can show it any time by running `rad .` from this directory.

    ✓ Project successfully announced to the network.

    Your project has been announced to the network and is now discoverable by peers.
    You can check for any nodes that have replicated your project by running `rad sync status`.

    To push changes, run `git push`.

Don't be afraid to do this on one of your existing public repositories! Because
even if you aren't ready to use Radicle for code collaboration, it works great
for distribution. Radicle's network of seed nodes help propagate and host code,
forming a decentralized, censorship resistant, and ungovernable distribution system.

What `rad init` does is gather the essential details from you which are needed
to initialize the repository into Radicle: the repository name, description,
default branch (typically `main` or `master`), and whether it is public or
private.

Similar to how `git init` is used to initialize a Git repository, we use
nomenclature you're familiar with so you don't go crazy. That'd be so cruel if
you had to do `rad new`, instead, wouldn't it?

> 👻
>
> It's important to only publish repositories you own or are a maintainer of,
> and to communicate with the other maintainers so that they don't initialize
> redundant repository identities.

After entering your repository details, you're presented with a Repository
Identifier (RID) that is a globally unique URN that you can share with your
collaborators or friends so that they can clone or seed your repository.
Besides generating the RID, `rad init` creates a special Git remote in your
working copy named `rad` and publishes the repository to the network (assuming
it's public). We'll talk more about private repositories in another chapter.

<aside class="span-2">
  <p>A <strong>Uniform Resource Name</strong> (URN) is a type of Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) that is used to uniquely identify resources without
  specifying the location or means to access them. Unlike URLs, which provide
  information on where a resource can be found on the Internet (their
  location), URNs serve as persistent, location-independent resource
  identifiers.</p>
</aside>

<aside class="kicker">
In Radicle, a <strong>delegate</strong> refers to a role or entity that has
been granted the authority to sign for and manage a repository and its metadata.
</aside>

When you initialize a repository you are the sole maintainer or *delegate*, the
term used in Radicle. Delegates can represent a group, person or even a bot. In
your case, I'm assuming you're a person. Delegates can be added or removed from
a repository, by existing delegates. We'll talk about this more in one of the
next chapters.

Note that your new repository will only be replicated by nodes that you are
connected to and either have an open seeding policy, or follow you. Seeding
involves both hosting the repository and synchronizing changes with other
nodes. In the early stages of the Radicle network, all public repositories are
automatically seeded by `iris.radicle.garden` and `rosa.radicle.garden` which
are *public seed nodes* run by the core team.

<!-- TODO: Talk about seeding policies and following -->

<aside class="span-2"> <strong>Seed nodes</strong> are always-on machines that
significantly enhance the network’s capacity to provide continuous access to
repositories. They can vary in their seeding policies, from public seed nodes
like <code>iris.radicle.xyz</code> and <code>rosa.radicle.xyz</code> that
openly seed all repositories, to community seed nodes that selectively seed
repositories based on rules established by their operators. </aside>

You don't *have* to trust or rely on our public seed node. You can run
your own. As more people run them, Radicle becomes more resilient and
reliable for code collaboration.

### Publishing *ch-ch-ch-ch-changes*

<div class="poem"> Still don't know what I was waiting for<br/> Requiring an
internet connection to push to remote<br/> But now I push to my local-first, oh so
`rad` remote<br/> Instead of that one shoddy monopolized forge </div>

As we just mentioned, `rad init` creates a special remote in your working copy
named `rad`. What's this doing under the hood? With Radicle, you will typically
be interacting with two different repository copies on your device, the
*working copy* and a hidden, *stored copy* that you interact with via `git push
rad` and `git pull rad` commands using Radicle's *git remote helper* program
named `git-remote-rad`. Remote helpers are particularly useful for integrating
Git with specialized network protocols like Radicle. Git calls the custom
`git-remote-rad` program when it encounters `rad://` remotes.

> 🧠
>
> Git remote helpers are custom programs that allow Git to interact with
> repositories hosted on various types of servers or protocols that are not
> natively supported. Remote helpers are invoked by Git when it encounters a URL
> scheme that matches a supported helper. For example, in Radicle's use case, if
> Git sees a URL starting with `rad://`, it will look for a remote helper program
> named `git-remote-rad` and use this program to handle operations related to
> that URL, such as fetching, pushing, and cloning. For more details, check out
> Git's [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitremote-helpers) on remote
> helpers.

To view information about the `rad` remote in your repository, try:

    $ git remote show rad
    * remote rad
      Fetch URL: rad://z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna
      Push  URL: rad://z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
      HEAD branch: (unknown)
      Remote branch:
        main tracked
      Local branch configured for 'git pull':
        main merges with remote main
      Local ref configured for 'git push':
        main pushes to main (up to date)

You'll notice the Repository ID in a URL format under `Fetch URL`:

    rad://z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna

For the `Push URL`, you may be wondering, what is the element after the slash?

    z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C

Does it look familiar to you? Well, it's your Node ID. Remember you can always
check your Node ID by running `rad self --nid`.

When using Git with traditional forges, you are pushing to a remote which is a
centralized server that all other collaborators are also using. In Radicle, the
remote is on your local device, which means that you can push changes even when
you're disconnected from the internet. Changes that you push to the remote
while offline will automatically propagate to the network once you come back
online. This is one of the very unique aspects of Radicle that makes offline
work *way smoother*.

<aside>
 When using GitHub, for example, you will be pushing to a remote URL that
 starts with <code>https://github.com/</code>, followed by an account and
 repository name. On Radicle, the URL you push to does not represent a specific
 host, it represents a de-centralized repository, identified by name only, not
 location.
</aside>

Now let's try publishing some changes to see how this works.

Use your favorite text editor to make a change to the repository that you just
initialized. For example, you can update its README to include instructions on
how to clone the repository on Radicle:

    $ git diff
    diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
    index 91b304791..70ef6efc9 100644
    --- a/README.md
    +++ b/README.md
    @@ -58,6 +58,12 @@

    +## Radicle
    +
    +To clone this repository on [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz), simply run:
    +
    +    rad clone rad:z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna
    +

Once you're finished, add and commit your changes with `git add` and `git
commit` just as you would when collaborating on any other Git repository. Then
use `git push rad master` to synchronize the changes with your node (be sure to
replace `master` with your default branch, in case that's not it).

    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit -m "Add instruction on cloning with Radicle"
    $ git push rad master
    ✓ Synced with 1 node(s)
    To rad://z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
       ecb1bf0..74fb8d2  master -> master

Whenever you execute a `git push rad` command, you are pushing the changes in
your local working copy to your remote copy. You see that the remote of your
repository is represented by the URL:

    rad://z31hE1wco9132nedN3mm5qJjyotna/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C

As the sole delegate of the repository, changes that you push to the
repository's default branch under the `rad` remote, represent the **canonical**
or *authoritative* state of the repository. This means that if someone were to
clone your repository, they would be getting the state that you just pushed,
given your nodes are able to communicate with each other.

> 🧠
>
> The canonical repository state is established *dynamically* based on the

> repository. In the current Radicle release, the dynamic establishment of an

> branches.

You may be wondering -- now that you've pushed to your remote, how do other
peers get this update? Any peer who has cloned or seeded the repository will
receive a *reference announcement* message from its peers, via the gossip
protocol, which informs the node there was an update. Following this, peers
conduct a *fetch* operation via the Git protocol to pull the pertinent Git
objects into their local storage.

### The basics of *seeding* and *cloning*

Nodes have a *seeding policy* which specifies the list of repositories they are
interested in replicating on the network.

Whenever you clone or initialize a new repository, your node's seeding policy
is updated to keep these repositories in sync with the network.

There are a few ways that seeding relationships are established among nodes.
One of the main methods is by one node intentionally *cloning* another
repository. You can run the `rad clone` command to clone a repository from the
Radicle network, by supplying a Repository Identifier (RID).

Let's try this out. First, navigate to a directory where you typically clone
Git repositories. Then run this command to clone the Radicle
[Heartwood][heartwood] repository:

<aside class="span-2"> Heartwood is the name of the current version of the
Radicle protocol. An alpha version was initially released in April 2023.

Cloning has some similarities to Git's `clone` command, in that it creates a
working copy of a remote repository, but this is executed in a much different
way since Radicle is a peer-to-peer protocol.

The `rad clone` command is essentially equivalent to running these lower-level
commands:

| **`rad seed`**       | Updates your seeding policy to start seeding this repository
| **`rad sync -f`**    | Fetches the latest repository data from other seeds and stores it in your local storage
| **`rad checkout`**   | Creates a working copy of the repository from local storage
| **`rad remote add`** | Creates a Git remote in your working copy for all repository delegates

When you only want to *seed* a repository and have no interest in contributing
code, you can still be a repository's friend with the `rad seed` command. This
is Radicle's version of a ⭐ *star* or 👍 *like*, where you show a repository
some real love and care by sharing it with others on the network.

<aside>
  <strong>Seeding</strong> a repository is a great way of supporting and giving
  back to a project you care about or use. By offering a little bandwidth to
  the network, you ensure the continued availability of the repository to
  others. ❤️
</aside>

This works similarly to cloning, where the RID is provided, the main difference
is that it doesn't create a working copy.

    $ rad seed rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5
    ✓ Seeding policy updated for rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5 with scope 'all'
    ✓ Fetching rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5 from z6Mkk4R…SBiyXVM..

When you seed a repository, it updates your seeding policy to subscribe to
updates. It fetches a copy of the repository under your local storage, and
provides a replica to the network.

In the future, if you change your mind and decide that you want to contribute
code to a repository you're seeding, you can always run `rad checkout` to
create a working copy of the repository from local storage and `rad remote add`
to create remotes of peers that you can pull from and push to.

If on the other hand you want to stop seeding a repository, simply run `rad
unseed`. For example:

    $ rad unseed rad:z9DV738hJpCa6aQXqvQC4SjaZvsi

You can list all of your seeded repositories with the `ls` sub-command:

    $ rad ls --seeded

If on the other hand you only want to see repositories you've contributed to in
some way, for example by pushing a branch or commenting on an issue, simply run
`ls` with no arguments:

    $ rad ls

This marks the end of our initial foray into Radicle. As we move forward to
Chapter 2, we'll dissect the collaborative mechanisms at play, exploring
issues and patches from the unique perspectives of both contributors and
delegates. It's here that the true kernel of *code collaboration* begins to
unfold.

## 2. Collaborating the Radicle Way

Now is the time to delve into Radicle's approach to working with social
artifacts like issues and patches. In the context of version control systems,
social artifacts refer to collaborative features that facilitate discussions,
bug tracking, and code review. Patches, in particular, represent proposed
changes to the codebase, often in response to issues or feature requests.
Unlike traditional centralized forges, Radicle leverages Git's distributed
version control system to allow you to maintain local copies of your
repository's associated issues and patches, alongside the repository source
tree.

<aside class="kicker"> Note that social artifacts are not stored in your
<em>working</em> copy. They are stored in the associate <em>bare</em>
repository as part of Radicle's local storage. Read more about Radicle storage
in the <a href="/guides/protocol#local-first-storage">Protocol Guide</a>.
</aside>

If you're familiar with Git, you know that when you `commit` code changes, a
unique hash called a commit hash is generated to identify that snapshot in
history. In Radicle, issues, patches, and their associated comments work
similarly to code commits. They are stored as Git objects within the repository
itself, each with its own unique Git Object ID (OID). This means that all
collaborative interactions, such as creating issues, submitting patches, and
commenting, are self-contained within the Git repository.

Furthermore, these objects are cryptographically signed by their author,
providing an additional layer of security and trust. This allows all
participants to independently verify the authenticity of the collaborative
interactions, ensuring the integrity of the project's history. By storing social
artifacts within Git and leveraging cryptographic signatures, Radicle
enables projects to operate independently of centralized platforms, giving users
full control over their collaborative data, and the ability to work offline.

<aside> The <strong>Git OID</strong> is a SHA-1 hash, which is a 160-bit number
typically represented as a 40-character hexadecimal string that uniquely
identifies objects within a Git repository. This identification is part of
Git's content-addressable storage system, ensuring the integrity of every piece
of data. </aside>

In Radicle, these collaborative social interactions are implemented using a
novel system of [Collaborative Objects][cobs] or simply "COBs" 🌽, that are
implemented using Git primitives.

<!-- TODO: Feels out of place?

You know what this all means? One day, creating an AI agent that codes and thinks
like you will be much easier than if you were to download the deepest parts of
your brain onto a platform owned by a megacorporation. There, it is an unknown
abyss, where your issues and thoughts are not hashed nor associated with public
keys. The platform has an iron grip on your data, feeding it to their mysterious
AI models without even giving you a peek behind the curtain.

That's the old system. The beauty of local-first systems like Radicle is that
everything is hashed and all your data is readily accessible from your local
machine. There is no need for complex API calls or special bots to extract
data for the projects you're working on, as you'll get it anytime you fetch.

### Working with *issues*

<div class="poem"> The more we git together<br>
Together, together<br>
The more we git together<br>
The happier we'll be</div>

<aside class="kicker span-2">
  <p> A <strong>Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)</strong> is a data
  structure that allows distributed systems to update data independently and
  resolve inconsistencies without central coordination. </p>
  <p> CRDTs ensure that all copies of some piece of data converge to the same
  state, making them ideal for environments with intermittent connectivity or
  where immediate consistency is not required. </p>
</aside>

Before we get into *issue management*, you should first get to know our trusted
friend, the COB 🌽. Discussing issues and patches is not natively supported by
Git, so we had to extend it. We named this data type a [Collaborative
Object][cobs] or "COB" for short. They use Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types
(CRDTs) under the hood for data consistency and are one of the fundamental
building blocks of the Radicle protocol.

<aside class="span-4">
  <p> Git has a built-in command called <code>git format-patch</code> that
  generates a patch file from commits. This patch file contains the changes made
  in the commits, along with metadata such as the commit message, author, and
  date. The patch file can then be easily shared with others via email or other
  means for review and discussion. </p>
  <p>This patch-based workflow is particularly popular in the Linux development
  community, where patches are often sent to mailing lists for review before
  being applied to the main repository. </p>
  <p>Radicle takes some ideas from this email based workflow but tries to
  offer a much more modern, secure, and user-friendly experience than that
  of email. </p>
</aside>

Now, to see how COBs are leveraged through the process of collaboration, we'll
open an issue under our "paxel" user alias, in a repository where we are a
contributor, but not a delegate.

We're going to `cd` into our copy of the `dark-star` repository we are
collaborating on, and open an issue with `rad issue open`. This will open your
text editor, prompting you to enter a title and description for the issue.
Radicle follows the same convention as Git commits when it comes to
inputing via an editor: the first line is a summary or *title* of the issue,
then comes the *description*, separated by a blank line.

    $ cd dark-star
    $ rad issue open

We'll enter the following title and description in our editor:

    Establish data standards for IUI Dark Star Data group

    As we go out and recruit the Neboriens and other intelligences to join
    the Intergalactic Union of Intelligences (IUI), we are going to have to
    establish standards for Dark Star data submissions.

When we save and close the editor, the issue is displayed on the command line:

    ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Title   Establish data standards for IUI Dark Star Data group │
    │ Issue   e4255cc2a0a65b543c2b5badac14bf9e0d9f409f              │

    │ standards for Dark Star data submissions.                     │
    ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Behind the scenes, `rad issue open` conjures up a brand-new COB for the issue,
bestowing upon it a unique identifier. This COB becomes the guardian of all the
metadata and interactions associated with the issue, ready to be replicated and
synced across the Radicle network.

COBs such as issues and patches can be created even when offline, since Radicle
is local-first. COBs you create offline will simply synchronize with the
network once you go online.

You can always see a table with all of the issues associated to a repository
by running `rad issue` within its working directory.

<pre class="wide"><code>$ rad issue

</code></pre>

Let's display an issue that looks interesting, using `rad issue show`:

    $ rad issue show 3e2f65
    ╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Title   Add anomalous data from ship 897AF                  │

<aside> This works exactly the same way as Git commit hashes: as long as the
given prefix is unambiguous, Radicle will resolve it to its full value.
</aside>

Let's compose a comment, with `rad issue comment`, expressing our interest in
tackling the issue.

    $ rad issue comment 3e2f65 --message "I can help."

    ╰─────────────────────────╯

This time, we used the command-line `--message` option to provide a comment,
but if you don't specify any option, you will be prompted to enter a message
via your editor, just like with `rad issue open`.

### Assigning issues

Now, let's enter Calyx's point of view for a second. Calyx is the maintainer of
the repository and is starting his day, gazing into a fresh terminal window,
where he enters `rad inbox`.

<pre class="wide"><code>$ rad inbox
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ dark-star                                                                                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 004   ●   3e2f653   Add anomalous data from ship 897AF   issue   open   calyx   1 hour ago │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
</code></pre>

The Radicle inbox is like a notifications center, displaying issues and patches
that are newly created or have unread comments or new activity.

> 👾
>
> If you run `rad inbox` from a Radicle repository, only notifications
> belonging to this repository will be shown. You can override this by using
> `--all` to show notifications from all repositories. If the command is run
> outside a Radicle repository, all repositories will be displayed.

Calyx decides to display the notification in his inbox with `rad inbox show`,
using the notification number.

    $ rad inbox show 4
    ╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Title   Add anomalous data from ship 897AF                  │

    ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

He sees that we (Paxel) left a comment and we're interested in helping with
the issue, and decides to assign it to us with `rad issue assign`.

    $ rad issue assign 3e2f653 --add did:key:z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C

He adds a comment to the issue as well.

    $ rad issue comment 3e2f653 --message "Great, I've assigned it to you."

> 👾

As a delegate of `dark-star`, Calyx has the rights to assign this issue. Calyx
can then use `rad issue show`, to confirm that the issue was correctly
assigned:

### Working with *patches*

The collaboration voyage doesn't stop at issues though! In the realm of code,
issues typically lead to *patches*.

Since Calyx has assigned the above issue to us, we'll start working on it by
making the changes in a new branch, and once we're done, we'll open a patch.
Let's dive into it step-by-step.

First, we need to make sure we're in our working copy of the `dark-star`
repository. You can always check the current Radicle repository using the `rad
.` invocation.

    $ rad .
    rad:z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc

Now, let's create a new branch where we'll add the missing data from ship
897AF, as mentioned in the issue. We happen to have this data right on our
system!

    $ git checkout -b anomalous-data-897af
    $ cp /var/run/897af.log data/897af.log
    $ git add data/

Finally, we commit our changes to the branch.

    $ git commit -m "Add anomalous data from ship 897AF"

Now that our changes are committed, we're ready to open a patch. To do so, we
simply push our branch to `refs/patches`, on `rad` remote.

<aside class="span-3"> The <code>refs/patches</code> remote reference is what
we call a <em>magic ref</em> 🪄 - it doesn't exist as a regular Git reference;
instead, Radicle intercepts the command and opens a new patch whenever you push
code to it using the Radicle remote helper. If you're familiar with <a
href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/" target="_blank">Gerrit</a>, Google's
code review tool, it works the same way!</aside>

    $ git push rad HEAD:refs/patches

Radicle will then open your editor, where the patch title can be edited and a
description can be added. Just like for issues, the first line of text is the
patch title, while the subsequent lines make up the description.

> 👾
>
> In the above command, `HEAD:refs/patches` is a *refspec*, where `HEAD` is a
> reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch, and
> `refs/patches` is a (magic) reference on the remote side. But you don't have
> to use `HEAD`; any local branch will do. Even an arbitrary commit hash can be
> used to open a patch!

<aside class="apan-2">
  A <strong>refspec</strong> in Git defines the relationship between local
  and remote references. It's a pattern used primarily with Git commands like
  <code>fetch</code>, <code>push</code>, and <code>pull</code> to specify which
  branches or commits should be transferred between the local repository and
  the remote repository. A refspec is composed of two parts, separated by a
  colon <code>:</code>, the <em>source</em> and the <em>destination</em>
  reference.
</aside>

Once we've entered the details describing the patch, we save and exit our
editor. This pushes our commit to the `rad` remote, opening the patch.

<pre class="wide">
✓ Patch e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617 opened
✓ Synced with 8 node(s)

To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
* [new reference]   HEAD -> refs/patches
</pre>

In the above Git output, we see our patch's identifier displayed:

    e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617

Patches are a type of COB 🌽, just like issues, and this is the SHA-1 hash that
uniquely identifies this patch.

In addition to opening a patch, the above `push` command creates a new remote
tracking branch and makes it the upstream of our `anomalous-data-897af` branch.
Any subsequent push from this original branch will now update the patch,
synchronizing our local changes with the network.

We can take a look at remote tracking branches using `git branch --remotes` to
understand this better.

    $ git branch --remotes
      calyx@z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap/main
      rad/main
      rad/patches/e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617

Here we see three branches: the `main` branch of Calyx (`calyx@z6Mk..`), our
own main branch (`rad/main`), and the branch associated with our recent patch
(`rad/patches/e5f0a..`).

We can also check the commit hashes associated with the `rad` remote references:

    $ git ls-remote rad
    e81db74197f48cc5198d9c03cceaec955af82abf  refs/heads/main
    80b8d420658834afc444a13c03f0c3ff6875a71c  refs/heads/patches/e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617

Since the `rad` remote is associated with our published copy of the repository,
these are the branch heads that are publicly accessible on the network.

### Updating patches

So let's say we'd like to update the patch we just submitted. We found some
formatting issues with the log file we included and we'd like to correct it
and update the patch.

First, let's dive into our editor and fix the formatting:

    $ vi data/897af.log

Then, we commit the changes and push.

    $ git commit --amend
    $ git push --force

To update the patch, we simply use `git push`. Since we amended the original
commit, we have to use the `--force` option when pushing. This is common
practice when a patch has been reworked.

As with opening a patch, this opens an editor to enter a reason for updating
the patch. Leave it blank if you'd like to skip that.

<pre class="wide"><code>✓ Patch e5f0a5a updated to revision 4d0c1156f8ac7af2297d1314cd7556185cd16ae4
✓ Synced with 6 node(s)

To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
 + b766431...80b8d42 anomalous-data-897af -> patches/e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617 (forced update)
</code></pre>

We see that the change that was pushed is represented by a new identifier:

    4d0c1156f8ac7af2297d1314cd7556185cd16ae4

This identifier represents the current version of the patch. Patch versions,
called *revisions* in Radicle, are immutable. Therefore, each update to a patch
creates a new revision, and patch updates are non-destructive, even when you
force-push.

<aside class="span-2"> The immutability of patch revisions makes code review a
<em>breeze</em>. It's easy to know what you've reviewed and you can quickly
tell what has changed since your last review by comparing patch revisions. </aside>

> 👾
>
> If the branch upstream is not set to the patch reference, eg.
> `rad/patches/e5f0a5a..`, you can set it with `rad patch set e5f0a5a`.

As with issues, we can display the patch using the `show` sub-command:

<pre class="wide"><code>$ rad patch show e5f0a5a

Notice at the bottom that there is a timeline, with the original patch head
(`b766431`) and the updated head (`80b8d42`) after a new revisions (`4d0c115`)
was created via a patch update.

Revisions are much more than changesets; they can carry useful metadata such as
reviews, comments, and a top-level description that spans all the commits under
it. That's why you see two identifiers for the revision, the first one is the
hash of the revision, and the second is the hash of the code itself (eg. your
branch head).

> as the patch itself, ie. `e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617` in the
> example above.

### Merging patches into the canonical

Now that we've opened a patch, let's switch perspectives again and return to
Calyx-land. Calyx will want to `checkout` the patch, review it, possibly make
changes and run tests, and then `merge` it. Let's walk through this process
together.

First, within the repository, Calyx runs `rad patch` and notices there is a new patch.

<pre class="wide"><code>$ rad patch
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ●  ID       Title                                Author           Head     +       -   Updated    │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ●  e5f0a5a  Add anomalous data from ship 897AF   z6MkvZw…7aCGq3C  80b8d42  +50382  -0  1 hour ago │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
</code></pre>

Calyx then uses the `checkout` sub-command of `patch` to switch to the patch:

    $ rad patch checkout e5f0a5a
    ✓ Switched to branch patch/e5f0a5a at revision 4d0c1156f8ac7af2297d1314cd7556185cd16ae4
    ✓ Branch patch/e5f0a5a setup to track rad/patches/e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617

When collaborating with peers, it’s often useful to be able to checkout a patch
in its own branch. With a patch checkout, you can browse the code, run tests
and even propose your own revision to the patch.

The `checkout` sub-command switches to a new local branch which has the patch
checked out at a specific revision. By default, the latest of the patch
author's revisions is chosen, but you can specify a different revision using
the `--revision` option. See `rad patch --help` for more information.

> 👾
>
> If you'd just like to view the patch changes without checking out the code,
> use the `diff` command!
>
>     rad patch diff e5f0a5a
>

It's a rare occasion that someone submits a perfect patch that can be merged
as-is. For example, in some cases a maintainer may want to rebase the patch's commits on top
of the main branch, which could have moved since the patch was proposed.

Calyx will do just that by running the following command from the patch
checkout:

    $ git rebase main

This replays the patch's commits on top of the current `main` branch. All
that's left to do is to update the patch itself, with a new revision:

    $ git push -o patch.message="Rebased!" --force
    ✓ Patch e5f0a5a updated to revision 1e0596d917725c447106b1efc900bebf4b95a810
    ✓ Synced with 12 node(s)

    To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap
    * [new branch]      patch/e5f0a5a -> patches/e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617

Although Calyx isn't the author of the patch  he can propose a new revision. In
fact, *anyone* can do that, and you will see their revision if you follow them!

Since Calyx did a rebase, the `--force` flag was required. Notice also the  `-o
patch.message` option; this allows Calyx to directly provide a comment related
to this revision, bypassing his editor.

> 🧠

If we look at the patch now, we'll see the new revision Calyx just pushed:

    $ rad patch show e5f0a5a
    ...
    │ ● opened by z6MkvZw…7aCGq3C (b766431) 2 hours ago                           │
    │ ↑ updated to 4d0c1156f8ac7af2297d1314cd7556185cd16ae4 (80b8d42) 2 hours ago │
    │ * revised by calyx in 1e0596d (25f8515) 3 minutes ago                       │
    ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Here we see that Calyx's changes are associated to the revision identifier
starting with `1e0596d` and to the commit hash `25f8515`.

To merge this latest revision, Calyx uses regular Git commands. When Radicle
detects that a patch's revision was merged into the main branch, the associated
patch is marked as *merged*.

<aside class="span-2"> In this guide, we use the term <em>main branch</em> to
mean the branch configured as the repository's <em>default branch</em> during
the repository initialization process (<code>rad init</code>). You can check
which branch is set as your default branch using the <code>rad inspect
--payload</code> command. </aside>

First Calyx merges the patch's changeset into the `main` branch, by merging
the patch branch he is on:

    $ git checkout main
    Switched to branch 'main'
    Your branch is up to date with 'rad/main'.
    $ git merge patch/e5f0a5a
    Updating e81db74..25f8515
    Fast-forward
    data/897af.log | 50382 ++++++++++
    1 file changed, 50382 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 data/897af.log

Then he pushes `main` to the `rad` remote.

    $ git push rad main
    ✓ Patch e5f0a5a5adaa33c3b931235967e4930ece9bb617 merged at revision 1e0596d
    ✓ Canonical head updated to 25f851529d68180a780cfafc15a48b89208ba8c4
    ✓ Synced with 7 node(s)

    To rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap
      e81db74..25f8515  main -> main

This marks the patch as *merged*, as seen in the output, updates the
repository's **canonical** or "authoritative" state to `25f851`, and
synchronizes the changes with the network.

The patch no longer shows up under `rad patch`:

    $ rad patch
    Nothing to show.

We can verify that it is merged via `rad patch show e5f0a5a`, or `rad patch
--merged`, which shows all merged patches.

### From remote viewing to adding remotes

Whenever you `init` or `clone` a repository, your node will follow all peers
for that repository, which means that everyone's patches and issues will be
synchronized to your device.

You can change this behavior by specifying a different scope when cloning or
initializing a repository, with the `--scope` option. For example, `--scope
followed` will only synchronize changes by peers you explicitly follow with the
`rad follow` command. The default is `--scope all`.

But if a peer becomes a regular collaborator, it would be useful to add them as
a Git remote to track their changes and `checkout` their branches, even if
they haven't been submitted as patches. The `rad remote` family of commands
can help you achieve this.

Calyx decides to do this, and adds us (Paxel) as a remote:

    rad remote add z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C --name paxel

This allows Calyx to keep up with our changes by creating a remote tracking
branch in his working copy, that has our main branch as its upstream.

<pre class="wide"><code>$ git remote -v
paxel   rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C (fetch)
paxel   rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C (push)
rad     rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc (fetch)
rad     rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap (push)
</code></pre>

In the above output, we see the names of the remotes on the left. We see that
the `paxel` remote points to a different namespace than the `rad` remote, which
points to Calyx's namespace. Remotes can also be viewed using `rad remote`:

    $ rad remote
    paxel z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C (fetch)
    rad   (canonical upstream)                             (fetch)
    rad   z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap (push)

Now that a remote is setup, Calyx can fetch our branches with `git fetch`:

    $ git fetch paxel
      From rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc/z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C
        * [new branch]      dark-star-secrets       -> paxel/dark-star-secrets

Oh darn, what has he found! If you don't want a branch to be published on
the Radicle network, avoid pushing it to your `rad` remote!

> 👾
>
> You can always use `rad remote list --untracked` to find peers that you are
> following but are not tracking in your working copy.

### Synchronizing the canonical

Now that Calyx has updated the repository's `main` branch by merging our patch,
all we need to do is pull those changes ourselves, to have the most up to date
state.

We'll start by switching back to our `main` branch with `git checkout main`,
and then we'll initiate a regular `pull`:

    $ git pull
    Fetching rad
    From rad://z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc
      e81db74..25f8515  main       -> rad/main
    Updating e81db74..25f8515
    Fast-forward
    ...

> 🧠
>
> The `git pull` command is really just a `git fetch` followed by a `git
> merge`. If you're comfortable with Git, it can be a good idea to first run
> the `fetch`, see which remote-tracking branches were updated, and decide what
> to merge yourself.

There we go, our working copy is now up to date with Calyx's.

If you get `Already up to date.`, it could mean that the changes pushed by
Calyx haven't reached your node yet. In that case, it's a good idea to ask
your node to fetch changes from the network:

    $ rad sync --fetch
    ✓ Fetching rad:z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc from z6MkrLM…ocNYPm7..
    ✓ Fetching rad:z3cyotNHuasWowQ2h4yF9c3tFFdvc from z6Mkg5Z…4Q8qCHw..
    ✓ Fetched repository from 2 seed(s)

After the `sync` command succeeds, try to `git pull` again.

And, that's a wrap! You now know the most relevant nitty gritty details of how
to leverage Radicle for code collaboration.

*One thing to keep in mind is that Radicle doesn't have advanced code review
features yet for patches, but that is coming in a near-term release.*

## 3. Selectively Revealing Repositories

In his influential work, [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto][cyph-man] (1993), Eric
Hughes eloquently encapsulated the essence of privacy, stating: ***Privacy is
the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.*** This notion of
self-determination and control over one's personal information stands in stark
contrast to the reality of using "private repository" features on traditional
centralized code forges. In those systems, privacy is merely an illusion
maintained by terms of service agreements, as data is stored in cleartext, fully
accessible to the platform's employees, vulnerable to potential misuse or
leaks, and subject to external pressures such as government requests. Users are
left with no real control, forced to blindly trust that their code and data
won't be viewed, exploited, or even used without consent for purposes like
training large language models.

In contrast, Radicle's decentralized approach puts the power of privacy directly
in the hands of users by leveraging public key cryptography and granular access
control mechanisms. The *power to selectively reveal* is a foundational
principle in Radicle, fostering a more resilient and safer environment for
code collaboration. Through selective replication, private repositories are only
accessible to and replicated by repository collaborators, while fully encrypted
connections ensure confidential data transfer between peers.

By combining selective replication and encrypted and authenticated connections,
repositories are invisible to the rest of the network. This approach
effectively creates isolated spaces for private collaboration, forgoing the
need for encryption at rest.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to maintain sovereignty and control over a
private repository while collaborating with a set of peers and a trusted
seed node.

### Initializing a private repository

When a private repository is created in Radicle, it is only visible and
accessible to explicitly authorized peers. Privacy is extended to all aspects of
the repository, including its data, creation time, Repository ID (RID),
Collaborative Objects (COBs), and its set of collaborators.

To maintain this privacy during data transfer, all connections between nodes,
including those to seed nodes, are fully encrypted using an AEAD algorithm,
`ChaCha20-Poly1305`.

<aside class="span-2">
  <strong>ChaCha20-Poly1305</strong> is a modern AEAD encryption algorithm
  designed for speed and security. It combines two parts: ChaCha20, which
  scrambles the data to keep it secret, and Poly1305, which creates a unique
  "fingerprint" for the encrypted data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
  This system works efficiently on all types of devices, from smartphones to
  computers, without needing special hardware.
</aside>

To demonstrate how this works in practice, let's create a private repository for
a sensitive research project we're working on with our peer, Calyx. We'll start
by initializing a repository within a new directory named
`schrödingers-paradox` and committing our initial research findings:

    $ cd schrödingers-paradox
    $ git init
    $ cp ~/secrets/897af-captain.log data/897af-captain.log
    $ git commit -a -m "Add captain's log from ship 897AF"

Next, to securely share this with Calyx, we initialize it as a private
repository in Radicle using the `--private` flag:

<aside class="kicker"><code>Paxel</code></aside>

    $ rad init --private

This invocation functions similarly to the public repository initialization
process; the key difference is that it automatically configures the
`visibility` option of the repository to private. As a result, the repository
remains unannounced 🥷 and unpublished on the network, reflecting its nature.

    $ rad init --private

    Initializing private radicle 👾 repository in /home/paxel/src/schrödingers-paradox..
    ...

    Your Repository ID (RID) is rad:z3jEQE4VMzkR1UVeSLiN9E8AMtV6a.
    You can show it any time by running `rad .` from this directory.

    You have created a private repository.
    This repository will only be visible to you, and to peers you explicitly allow.

    To make it public, run `rad publish`.
    To push changes, run `git push`.

If we run `rad ls --private`, we'll find the repository with its `private`
visibility.

<pre class="wide">
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Name                   RID                                 Visibility  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ schrödingers-paradox   rad:z3jEQE4VMzkR1UVeSLiN9E8AMtV6a   private     │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
</pre>

### Curating the *allow* list

Now that we have our private repository, the next step is to grant access to our
collaborators.

The newly created private repository, `schrödingers-paradox`, will initially be
accessible only by us, the lone delegate. This is due to the fact that
repository delegates always have access to their private repositories. However,
to collaborate on this repository with others, we need to curate its allow list
to include the DIDs of Calyx, and at least one [seed node][seeder] *we trust*.
This seed node will act as a trusted relay, necessary for the synchronization
of repository state between Calyx and us.

Though this trusted seed node needs a public DNS address, it doesn't have to
be advertised to the network. One can simply omit adding the address to
the `externalAddresses` key in the Radicle node configuration.

> 👻
>
> Private repositories are not encrypted at rest, so any node that you add to
> the allow list will have visibility over the contents of your private
> repository. In the [Chapter 4][ch4] we explore a different setup that works
> over Tor and doesn't require a trusted seed node.

We can add both Calyx and our trusted seed node to the allow list using a single
`rad id update` command. This command requires a `--title` for the update, along
with each authorized DID specified with the `--allow` flag:

    $ rad id update --title "Allow Calyx and seed.darkstar.example" \
        --allow did:key:z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap \
        --allow did:key:z6MkqNZS9QWvC4wbZ8Vz4hQZ1FzN8q4XGj2KGmK9qNgQ8VWt

Once we submit the update above, it is automatically approved, as we are the
repository's sole delegate. If you look at the resulting diff, you see that
both Calyx and our trusted node are being added to the `allow` list under the
`visibility` key:

```json
"allow": [
  "did:key:z6Mkgom1bTxdh9fMFxFNXFMw3SbXnma6NARdsfcFuunurCap",
  "did:key:z6MkqNZS9QWvC4wbZ8Vz4hQZ1FzN8q4XGj2KGmK9qNgQ8VWt"
]
```

### Replicating to our seed node

Now that we've set up our private repository, it's essential to configure it
from our trusted seed node. Since our seed node is likely configured with a
selective seeding policy, we'll have to tell it to seed our private repository
with the `rad seed` command.

Since `schrödingers-paradox` is a private repository, we also need to specify
our (Paxel's) Node ID using the `--from` flag to explicitly indicate a source
node to fetch from. We therefore run the following command from within an SSH
session on our seed node:

<aside class="kicker"><code>seed.darkstar.example</code></aside>

    $ rad seed rad:z3jEQE4VMzkR1UVeSLiN9E8AMtV6a --from z6MkvZwzK64f3GuDcAs6dEcje89ddfHkBjS1v9Dkh7aCGq3C

This will update darkstar's seeding policy and attempt to fetch the repository
from our node. For the fetching to be successful, we'll have to be connected
to the seed node. Check that it is indeed the case with `rad node status`,
and use `rad node connect` or adjust your node's configuration if it isn't
the case.

Once the repository is on the seed, you should be able to see it by running
`rad ls --private` from within the SSH session. It can then serve as an always
online reliable access point for other authorized peers. Remember, only peers
on the repository's allow list will be able to fetch from this seed node.

### Cloning as a trusted peer

With our repository now successfully seeded, Calyx can clone our project. Since
`schrödingers-paradox` is a private repository, Calyx needs to specify the seed
node to fetch from, using the `--seed` flag. In this case, Calyx specifies
the Node ID of `seed.darkstar.example`:

<aside class="kicker"><code>Calyx</code></aside>

    $ rad clone rad:z3jEQE4VMzkR1UVeSLiN9E8AMtV6a --seed z6MkqNZS9QWvC4wbZ8Vz4hQZ1FzN8q4XGj2KGmK9qNgQ8VWt

Once the repository is fetched, it's no longer necessary to specify the seed.
Commands such as `rad sync` will automatically try to sync with our trusted
seed.

*With a local copy of the repository, Calyx can now collaborate freely,
in full secrecy.*

### Removing nodes from the *allow* list

In the event that our seed node became compromised, we could revoke access
privileges to the repository from it. The same `rad id update` command is used,
but this time with the `--disallow` flag:

    $ rad id update --title "Darkstar is compromised!" \
        --disallow did:key:z6MkqNZS9QWvC4wbZ8Vz4hQZ1FzN8q4XGj2KGmK9qNgQ8VWt

Our *no-longer-trusted* seed node will now be unable to fetch updates from us
for `schrödingers-paradox`.

## 4. Embracing the Onion

**[Tor][tor]**, "The Onion Router", is a decentralized network that
anonymizes users' online activity by routing internet traffic through
multiple encrypted relays, providing stronger anonymity compared to traditional
VPNs.

<aside class="span-3"> Tor, originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory in the 1990s, was designed to protect government communications. It
was further developed by DARPA before becoming a public project. In 2006, the
non-profit Tor Project was established to maintain and improve the network.
Today, Tor is widely used by individuals, activists, journalists, and
organizations seeking greater online privacy.</aside>

To further enhance repository and user privacy, Radicle nodes can be
configured to run behind Tor. This allows connections to be made to `.onion`
addresses, as well as hiding one's IP address and exposing Radicle as a Tor
*onion service*.

Depending on how you configure Radicle, it offers several key advantages:

* **Enhanced anonymity**: Your node's real IP address is hidden, making it
  difficult for others to track your online activities or determine your
  location.
* **NAT traversal**: Tor automatically handles [NAT traversal][nat],
  eliminating the need for manual port forwarding or UPnP configuration. This
  means peers can directly connect with one another without a seed node, even
  behind a restrictive firewall.
* **Censorship resistance**: Repositories accessible via Tor are more resilient
  against censorship attempts, as the Tor network is designed to circumvent
  blocking.

[nat]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal

Network Address Translation (NAT) typically creates barriers for direct
peer-to-peer communication. Devices behind NAT gateways are often isolated
with non-routable private IP addresses, making them inaccessible from the public
internet. This is common in most consumer internet setups.

Tor addresses this issue by providing static `.onion` addresses – cryptographic
identifiers representing nodes that are routable across the Tor network. This
allows peers behind NAT to connect directly without needing to know each
other's public IP addresses, overcoming limitations faced by traditional
peer-to-peer networks.

This chapter will explore a few distinct ways to configure Radicle with Tor:

1. **Mixed Mode**: Only connections to `.onion` addresses go through Tor, while
   other connections work normally.
2. **Full Proxy Mode**: All traffic is routed through Tor for maximum anonymity,
    including traffic to nodes that are *not* behind Tor.
3. **Transparent Proxy Mode**: Leverages an existing fully transparent Tor proxy on
   the network.

Before proceeding, ensure you have Tor installed on your system. Use your
preferred package manager to install it (the package name is typically "tor").
For detailed instructions, refer to the Tor [installation guide][install-tor].


### Setting up a Tor Onion Service for Radicle

We've been collaborating with Calyx on the private `schrödingers-paradox`
repository. Recently, we removed a compromised seed node from the repository's
`allow` list, which inadvertently cut off Calyx's access to the repository.

To restore Calyx's access and enhance the security of our sensitive research,
we'll configure our node as a Tor Onion Service (also known as a hidden
service). This setup will make our node accessible via a `.onion` address,
allowing Calyx to connect directly to us without relying on any intermediaries.

Let's set up our Tor Onion Service. The following steps are for Linux-based
systems, but they should be similar for other operating systems.

First we create a new `radicle` directory for our Onion Service, ensuring it's
readable and writable:

    $ sudo mkdir -m 700 /var/lib/tor/radicle

This directory will store information and cryptographic keys for our Onion
Service.

Then we update our Tor configuration (`/etc/tor/torrc`) by adding the following
lines to it:

    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/radicle
    HiddenServicePort 8776

These lines set the `HiddenServiceDir` to the path of the directory we just
created and specify the `HiddenServicePort` as `8776`, which is the default
Radicle node port.

Finally, we restart our Tor daemon to apply the configuration changes:

    $ sudo systemctl restart tor

Our `.onion` address is stored in a file under our Onion Service
directory. Let's take a look:

    $ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/radicle/hostname
    1odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion

We can copy this address to our clipboard, as we'll need it to configure our
Radicle node in the next steps.

#### Configuring Radicle in *Mixed Mode*

Now that we have Tor properly set up, it's time to configure the networking on
our Radicle node to work with it. There are several configuration options
available, but for our use case, we'll implement the *Mixed Mode* where only
connections to `.onion` addresses go through Tor, while regular connections go
through the regular internet. For our particular use-case, we're trying to
collaborate on a private repository, not to hide our IP address.

This configuration offers a balance between privacy and performance:

* It maintains low latency for regular public nodes.
* It allows connectivity through Tor, for nodes that are exposed as an onion
  service.

<figure class="diagram">
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/images/tor-mixed-mode.svg"></object>
  <figcaption>Tor <em>Mixed Mode</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>

To set this up, we first ensure that our Radicle node is stopped and then edit
our node's configuration file:

    $ rad node stop
    $ rad config edit

Under the `node` key in our configuration, we define a new `onion` attribute
as follows:

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "onion": {
        "mode": "proxy",
        "address": "127.0.0.1:9050"
    }
}
```

This tells Radicle that for `.onion` addresses, we want to use the specified
Tor *SOCKS5* proxy address. This is the address on which the Tor daemon should
be listening.

Next, we ensure our node is listening for incoming connections on port `8776`.
This is the port that our Tor proxy will be using to bridge connections to our
node, and is the same as the `HiddenServicePort` in our Tor configuration.

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "listen": ["0.0.0.0:8776"]
}
```

Finally, if we want our `.onion` address to be publicly *discoverable* on the
network, we add it to our `externalAddresses`, including the port. This will
configure our node to advertise its `.onion` address to peers.

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "externalAddresses": [
        "1odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion:8776"
    ]
}
```

> 👾 This is the `.onion` address we obtained earlier from the Tor `hostname`
> file.

Note that this is **optional**: if you don't specify it here, peers will still
be able to connect to you if they know your `.onion` address.

This configuration allows our node to use Tor for `.onion` connections while
maintaining direct connections for regular traffic, balancing our privacy and
performance needs.

#### Making connections

Now that we have updated our configuration, we can start up our node again:

    $ rad node start

Since our node is online, Calyx can now continue to collaborate with us on
`schrödingers-paradox`. He uses the `rad node connect` command to establish a
direct connection with us:

<aside class="kicker"><code>Calyx</code></aside>

    $ rad node connect z6Mkhp7VUnuufpvuQ3PdysShAjL86VDRUpPpkesqiysDBGs9@odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion:8776

Notice that the connect address is a combination of the peer's NID and its
`.onion` address:

    <nid> @ <onion> : <port>

Tor connections can take some time to establish as a route through the network
of relays is computed. If you want your node to maintain a persistent
connection to a peer even after your node is restarted, simply add the above
address to the `connect` field in your node configuration:

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "connect": [
        "z6Mkhp7VUnuufpvuQ3PdysShAjL86VDRUpPpkesqiysDBGs9@odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion:8776"
    ]
}
```

By leveraging Radicle's private repositories and the Tor network, we protected
our project's confidentiality and stood resilient in the face of attacks on our
infrastructure. When nodes are *Torrified* like ours is, it's also easy for
other peers to establish connections directly with us, without requiring an
intermediary seed node.

> Of course, Tor can also be set up on a seed node for a persistent, private

### Alternative Tor configurations

While Mixed Mode allows us to connect to Tor nodes and traverse NATs, there are
two additional configurations that offer more comprehensive network privacy
through Tor, at the expense of network latency. These options route all Radicle
traffic through the Tor network, including to nodes that are not configured
with Tor.

#### Full Proxy Mode

Full Proxy Mode routes all traffic through Tor for maximum anonymity.

<figure class="diagram">
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/images/tor-full-proxy-mode.svg"></object>
  <figcaption>Tor <em>Full Proxy Mode</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Instead of setting up a proxy only for `.onion` addresses, we set up a global
proxy for all address types:

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "proxy": "127.0.0.1:9050"
}
```

Then, we change the `mode` for `.onion` addresses to `forward`, and remove
the `proxy` configuration from there:

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "onion": {
        "mode": "forward"
    }
}
```

The `listen` and `externalAddresses` configuration doesn't change.

#### Transparent Proxy Mode

If you've already set up a fully transparent Tor proxy on your network, simply
omit the global proxy configuration, and set the `.onion` configuration to
`forward`:

<aside class="span-2">Configuring a transparent Tor proxy for your entire
network is beyond the scope of this guide. If you're interested in this setup,
consult the Tor Project documentation for detailed instructions.</aside>

```json
"node": {
    ...
    "onion": {
        "mode": "forward"
    }
}
```

This will configure your node to use your operating system's DNS resolver
to resolve `.onion` addresses.

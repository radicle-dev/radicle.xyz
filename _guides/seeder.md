To seed is to give back. By seeding repositories on the Radicle network, you
offer bandwidth, storage, and data availability to Radicle users.

In this guide, we'll go through the various steps required to set up a Radicle
*seed node* on a Linux system. Seeding only requires an internet
connection, a public, static IP address, and modest hardware.

We'll cover public seed nodes with an *open* seeding policy, as well as
community seed nodes with more *selective* policies.

Introduction
------------
The term *seed node* originally comes from [BitTorrent]. In the
BitTorrent protocol, nodes that possess the data for a given torrent file
and begin uploading it to peers are called *seeders*.

In Radicle, while all users contribute to the network by seeding data, the term
*seed node* specifically refers to a server that is accessible through the
internet and hosts content for peers. Seed nodes need to remain online and
accessible to provide their service to the network.

### The need for seed nodes

While a peer-to-peer network without seed nodes is feasible, it is impractical.
This is because regular "user" nodes go online and offline all the time, so
finding a user from which to download a certain piece of content can be
challenging, or even impossible if all users with that content are offline.

Therefore, a healthy peer-to-peer network necessitates at least *some* highly
available nodes that participate in the network like regular peers, but seldom
go offline. These are called seed nodes.

Getting Started
---------------
For this guide, we'll focus on setting up a seed node using `systemd`. If
you're running a different service manager, you should be able to follow along
just fine, as we'll be explaining the steps. Using a service manager is not
required, but highly recommended.

### What you will need

To run a Radicle seed node, you will need a server with:

* `curl`
* `git`
* `systemctl` version `232` or newer
* `sudo` privileges
* A DNS name pointing to your server

### Server

If you already have a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or home server running a
Linux distribution, you should be all set. If not, any VPS will do. Between 1-2GB
of RAM with a shared CPU and 10GB of disk space should be enough to get started.
Once you've logged into your server, proceed with user setup and installation.
For this setup process, you'll need `sudo` capabilities.

> **Tip**: If you have trouble choosing a VPS, we recommend getting a small
> instance on [Hetzner][hetzner] or [Digital Ocean][do]. These are priced
> fairly and have good documentation and support.

### User setup

If you wish to create a new user under which to run the seed node services,
this is the time. In this guide, we've chosen to run our services under a user
called `seed`. Radicle data and configuration will be stored under this user's
home folder. This ensures that if your Radicle services were to be compromised,
the attacker would have very limited access to your system.

Here's an example user setup with `seed` as the user and group name:

    sudo groupadd --system seed
    sudo useradd --system --gid seed --create-home seed

If you're administering your server via a non-root account, you'll want to
add it to the `seed` group as well:

    sudo usermod -a -G seed $(whoami)

### Installation

For a seed node, you will need to install at minimum the Radicle CLI (`rad`),
and network daemon (`radicle-node`).

To install these, head over to the [download] page and follow the
instructions there. You will have to download, verify and extract the binaries
and manuals to your preferred location.

For this guide, we recommend installing Radicle under `/usr/local`. This will
require you to have write permissions to `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/man`.
You can give yourself these permission by changing ownership of these
directories to the current user and group:

    $ sudo chown $(whoami): /usr/local/{bin,man,man/man1}

You should then be able to extract the archive you downloaded and verified
with:

    $ tar -xvJf <archive> --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/

Finally, login as the `seed` user and proceed with installation:

    sudo su seed

To check your installation, run the `rad` command, and confirm where your
Radicle home is with the `rad path` command.

To offer web browsing and HTTP access to your seed node, you will additionally
need to run `radicle-httpd`, the HTTP daemon. We'll cover this after we've
set up our basic node.

### Creating a profile

Once the Radicle binaries are installed, we can create a Radicle *profile*. This
consists of an Ed25519 key pair and a directory under which Radicle stores user
data.

    rad auth --alias seed.radicle.example

The above command will create a profile with the given node *alias* in
`~/.radicle`, or `$RAD_HOME` if set. We recommend setting your alias to the
domain name that points to your node's host.

For seed nodes, it's not generally necessary to set up a passphrase for your
key, so you can simply skip that prompt by pressing *enter*.

<aside>
Seed nodes do not typically sign any permanent artifacts with their key. It
is mainly used for securing connections with peers.
</aside>

> **Tip**: If you wish to set a passphrase anyway, you will have to set the
> `RAD_PASSPHRASE` environment variable in your node's `systemd` unit file.

Once your profile is initialized, a decentralized identifier (DID) will be
output. The part after the `did:key:` prefix is your Node ID. This is how your
seed node will be identified on the network. The Node ID is the public part of
the Ed25519 key pair generated above, via `rad auth`.

You can view information about your Radicle profile by running `rad self`. The
`--nid` and `--alias` flags can be used to return the Node ID and alias.

Configuring Your Node
---------------------
There are a couple of things we need to set up a seed node.

First, we must set the node's default *seeding policy*.

The seeding policy tells the node which repositories and forks to fetch
and offer to the network. For *public seed nodes*, a *permissive* seeding policy
is often set, such that *all data* on the network is stored and replicated.

Second, we must set an *External Address* for the node to be reached on the
network. This address will be advertised to peers, allowing them to connect to
your seed node. Generally, this will be a DNS name with port `8776`, for
example `seed.radicle.example:8776`.

Here's an example minimal configuration file with a permissive seeding policy
and an external address set:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "alias": "seed.radicle.example",
    "listen": ["0.0.0.0:8776"],
    "externalAddresses": ["seed.radicle.example:8776"],
    "seedingPolicy": {
      "default": "allow",
      "scope": "all"
    }
  }
}
```

> In the above example the server listen to any IPv4 interface. If your host
> supports only IPv6 or if you want to support both IPv4 and IPv6, replace
> `0.0.0.0` with `[::]`.

Your node is configured with a file named `config.json` in your Radicle home
directory. You can get the full path of the config file with the `rad self
--config` command. Additionally, you can output the current configuration with
`rad config`. Attributes that aren't set in `config.json` will take on default
values. You can open your configuration file for editing with `rad config
edit`.

Let's start by configuring your seeding policy.

### Seeding policies

The most important setting when it comes to seeding is your *default seeding
policy*. This setting will determine what content your seed node fetches and
replicates on the network when it encounters a repository it doesn't know or
hasn't been given special instructions for.

The setting is configured under the `node.seedingPolicy` field in your
configuration (`~/.radicle/config.json`). You can open your configuration file
directly using the `rad config edit` command, or use your preferred editor. You
can also enter the following command to display your current default policy:

    rad config get node.seedingPolicy

When a seeding policy is *not set* for a specific repository or node, the
default policy is applied, hence the importance of this setting.

Broadly, there are two options for the default policy.

#### A *permissive* seeding policy

A *permissive* or "open" policy is said to be *fully-replicating*, meaning your
seed will try to have a full copy of all repository data available on the
network.

An example of a node with this policy is `iris.radicle.xyz`, a node operated
by the Radicle team, for the Radicle community.

This is a good default for seeders who want to support the network without
having to think about it too much.

Set `node.seedingPolicy.default` to `allow` and `node.seedingPolicy.scope` to
`all` to configure your node this way.

```json
{
  "node": {
    ...
    "seedingPolicy": {
      "default": "allow",
      "scope": "all"
    }
  }
}
```

#### A *selective* seeding policy

A *selective* or "restricted" policy requires you, the operator, to *manually
allow repositories to be seeded*. This means that the node will ignore
all repositories, except the ones that are pre-configured to allow seeding.

An example is the `seed.radicle.xyz` node, which only seeds Radicle team
repositories.

This is a good policy for communities, teams, companies and individuals who
want to limit the data hosted by their seed, or node operators who want
to require some form of authentication or payment for seeding.

Set `node.seedingPolicy.default` to `block` to enable this, and call `rad seed`
to configure `allow` policies for specific repositories you want to seed. Your
seed node won't seed anything until you explicitly allow it to.

```json
{
  "node": {
    ...
    "seedingPolicy": {
      "default": "block"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Setting a repository's seeding policy

To override the default policy for a specific repository, the `seed` or
`block` commands are used.

For example, in the case of a *permissive* seeding policy, where the default
is `allow`, we can explicitly *block* certain repositories from being seeded:

    rad block rad:z9DV738hJpCa6aQXqvQC4SjaZvsi

This will override the default policy and ensure that this repository is never
replicated on your node.

On the other hand, in the case of a *selective* seeding policy, where the default
policy is `block`, we can decide to *allow* a repository to be seeded by calling
`rad seed`. For example:

You can view your node's *default policy* by entering `rad config get node.seedingPolicy`.

    rad seed rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5

This will override the default `block` rule for this one specific repository.

To remove an override configured for a repository in either case, `unseed` can be used:

    rad unseed rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5

For both cases, the default policy will apply if a seeding policy is not defined for
a repository.


#### Viewing seeding policies

You can view your node's *default policy* by entering `rad config get node.seedingPolicy`.

To view the policy of a specific repository, use the `rad inspect` command. For
example:

    rad inspect rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5 --policy

This will return the default policy if you haven't set a specific policy for
that repository.

Finally, to view all seeding policies that have been configured on repositories,
simply enter `rad seed` with no options.

### Addressing

Now that you've configured your seeding policy, it's time to consider how your
node is addressed on the network.

#### Your external address

You should set your node's external address. This is a public address,
typically a DNS name that points to your node. Though a single external address
is sufficient, you are free to set up to 16 external addresses.

You'll find this setting in your configuration file, under
`node.externalAddresses`. External addresses are JSON strings of the form
`<host>:<port>`, for example `seed.radicle.example:8776`, where `<host>` is a
DNS name, and `<port>` is usually `8776`.

```json
{
  "node": {
    ...
    "externalAddresses": ["seed.radicle.example:8776"]
  }
}
```

Once at least one external address is set, you're ready to start your node
for the first time.

#### Your node address

For others to be able to connect to your node directly, they need your *Node
Address*. This is a combination of your Node ID and your External
Address.

If you've configured one or more external addresses, simply entering the
following command from the `seed` user will output your node addresses:

    rad node config --addresses

Share this with others, and they will be able to connect to your node using
`rad node connect <address>`, or by adding your address to their configuration,
under the `node.connect` field.

#### DNS-Based Service Discovery

If you would like to facilitate discovery of your node via DNS, you can do so
via [DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD)][dnssd]. This requires you to set
three DNS records per node you are running.

 1. A `SRV` record, which communicates the external address of your node
    (DNS name and TCP port number).
 2. A `TXT` record, which communicates the Node ID of your node.
 3. A `PTR` record, which makes the other two records discoverable.

Taken together, the `SRV` and `TXT` records contain all the information
required to reconstruct your node address.

Suppose the node address you want others to discover is
`z6MkXB…Z6sTAz@seed.radicle.example:58776` and the domain name you want it to
be discovered for is `radicle.example`, then the three DNS records required are:

```zone
seed._radicle-node._tcp.radicle.example.  3600  IN  SRV  32767 32767 58776 seed.radicle.example.
seed._radicle-node._tcp.radicle.example.  3600  IN  TXT  "nid=z6MkXB…Z6sTAz"
_radicle-node._tcp.radicle.example.       3600  IN  PTR  seed._radicle-node._tcp.radicle.example.
```

With most nameservers, there are shorter versions to denote these records, like
dropping TTL and record class, as well as abbreviating names by omitting the
origin. The variant above is purposely verbose to avoid ambiguity. Of course,
you may choose different values for the TTL.

With these records set, anyone can discover your nodes from the domain name
`radicle.example`. This method of discovery is ideal if you maintain a set of
nodes, and want to have them discovered by a group of people, such as your
collaborators or coworkers. It also works if your nodes addresses and/or ports
change frequently.

To find out more about the the interpretation of `SRV` records, refer to
[RFC 2782][srv].

Running Your Node
-----------------
Before setting up your node as a system service, it's a good idea to run it
once to make sure everything is working properly. Enter the following command
to start your node in the foreground:

    rad node start --foreground

You should see log output as your node starts to sync with the network.
If there are any errors or issues connecting to the network, you should see
errors in the output.

If the node started without problem, stop it with `Ctrl-C`, and exit the `seed`
session by entering:

    exit

This should return you to the original session you opened via SSH.

### Configuring your node's system service

Though it's possible to simply run the Radicle node as a background process,
it's recommended to set up a service to ensure the node is started on boot.

In this guide, we will only cover setup using `systemd`, but the process is
fairly similar for other service managers.

The first thing to do is to get a copy of the [`radicle-node.service`][radicle-node]
unit file. Place it in `/etc/systemd/system/radicle-node.service` for it to
be found by `systemctl`:

    curl -sS https://seed.radicle.xyz/raw/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5/570a7eb141b6ba001713c46345d79b6fead1ca15/systemd/radicle-node.service -o /etc/systemd/system/radicle-node.service

Make sure it fits your needs by editing the file directly, or creating an
override using `systemctl edit`.

> The downloaded `systemd` unit file is configured to run your node process as
> the `seed` user and group, for security reasons. If you set up a different
> user or group name, or set a passphrase during `rad auth`, or if you want to
> listen on an IPv6 interface, you will have to make edits to this file before
> proceeding.

When you're ready, you can **enable** and **run** the service:

    systemctl enable --now radicle-node

### Checking your node status

To check the service status of your node, run:

    systemctl status radicle-node

Besides using `systemctl status`, you can also check your node's status using
`rad node status`. This will give you information on the peers connected to
your node. You'll have to run this as the `seed` user, like so:

    sudo -u seed -- rad node status

To tail your node's logs, use:

    journalctl --unit radicle-node --follow

### Changing your node's configuration

If you change your node's configuration while the node is running, you'll
need to restart your node for the changes to take effect.

First, verify that the new configuration is valid by running `rad config`, then
restart your node with:

    systemctl restart radicle-node

### Securing the `seed` user

Now that your node is configured and working, you can secure the `seed` user by
disabling shell access. This is optional, though recommended.

    chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin seed

This will prevent anyone from logging in as the `seed` user. Note that from
this point onwards, if you chose to disable the `seed` user's shell, you'll
have to run all commands via `sudo`, like we've been doing so far.

> To facilitate running commands as the `seed` user by simply using `rad` as
> usual, add this alias to your admin shell's init scripts:
>
>     alias rad='sudo -u seed -- rad'

### Firewalls

If you are running a firewall, ensure that port `8776` is open for TCP
connections. This will allow inbound connections to your node.

> It's recommended to run a basic firewall to further lock down your server,
> using something like `iptables`, though this is out of scope for this guide.

Running the HTTP Daemon
------------------------
In the prior sections, we set up `radicle-node`, a background process that
actively and continuously discovers and replicates repositories on the network,
based on your seeding policy. This node allows users to collaborate, host,
share, and publish repositories on the network via the Radicle CLI or any
compatible application. However, at this stage, the repositories on your seed
node cannot be browsed or viewed without cloning them first, using the Radicle CLI.
To enable web browsing of the content of your seed node, the Radicle HTTP Daemon
`radicle-httpd` needs to be deployed alongside `radicle-node`.

The HTTP Daemon is a background process that functions as a *gateway* between
the Radicle protocol and the HTTP protocol. It is configured to have direct
read-only access to the node's storage and database and expose this data via an
HTTP JSON API. For seed nodes, the HTTP Daemon is always configured as a
*read-only* service over the node's state.

### Installation

Head over to the [download] page, and follow the instructions there. The
process is the same as for the Radicle Node. You will have to download, verify
and extract the binary (`radicle-httpd`) and manuals to your preferred
location.

We recommend installing the daemon under `/usr/local`, just as we did for the
node.

### Configuring your HTTP daemon's system service

As with `radicle-node`, we can start by downloading an example `systemd` unit
file for the daemon:

    curl -sS https://seed.radicle.xyz/raw/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5/570a7eb141b6ba001713c46345d79b6fead1ca15/systemd/radicle-httpd.service -o /etc/systemd/system/radicle-httpd.service

Make sure it fits your needs by editing the file directly, or creating an
override using `systemctl edit`.

> In this guide, all `systemd` unit files are configured to run the process as
> the `seed` user and group, for security reasons. If you set up a different
> user or group name, you will have to make edits to these files before running
> the services.

Then, **enable** and **run** the service:

    systemctl enable --now radicle-httpd

You can check that your node service is running with:

    systemctl status radicle-httpd

You can query the API with `curl` to ensure everything is working properly:

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1

### Adding support for HTTPS

For your HTTP Daemon to be accessible from a frontend such as
<https://app.radicle.xyz>, it needs to respond to HTTPS requests. To do this,
we recommend using [Caddy][caddy].

Start by installing `caddy`; most Linux distributions have a package you can
install. If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you can run:

    apt-get install caddy

If you're having trouble installing Caddy, check the [installation
guide][caddy-install]. Once installed, run `caddy version` to ensure that
everything was installed correctly.

    caddy version
    v2.6.4 h1:2hwYqiRwk1tf3VruhMpLcYTg+11fCdr8S3jhNAdnPy8=

Then, download the `caddy` unit file from Caddy's GitHub repository:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caddyserver/dist/master/init/caddy.service -o /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service

Edit the file and change the `User` and `Group` attributes to `seed`, as we
have for the other services. Also ensure that `ExecStart` and `ExecReload`
are set to the correct path. You can find the path under which `caddy` is
installed by running the `which caddy` command.

Finally, edit or create the `Caddyfile` at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, and *replace*
its contents with the following configuration, using the correct domain name
for your seed:

    seed.radicle.garden {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
    }

This will proxy all HTTPS requests from port `443` to your HTTP daemon running
on port `8080`. Make sure your firewall has port `443` open for incomning TCP
connections.

Finally, enable and start the Caddy service:

    systemctl enable --now caddy

If you encounter issues setting up Caddy, you can try following their
[guide][caddy-guide] instead.

If everything worked, you should now have HTTPS support for your daemon. To
check, run the following command, replacing `seed.radicle.garden` with your
seed's domain:

    curl https://seed.radicle.garden/api/v1

You should now be able to visit your seed node via any Radicle web frontend as
well. For example, <https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.garden>.

> On some distributions, installing `caddy` will start the system service
> automatically. If you're not able to connect to your HTTP daemon from the
> outside, try running `systemctl reload caddy` after you've updated the
> configuration.

You're All Set
